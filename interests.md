I am interested in basic and translational research centered around cell identity.

## Directed changes of cell identity

![iPSC-CM]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/iPSC-CM.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

How should we rationally design protocols for manipulating cell identity? Each cell type displays complex, characteristic properties


## Models of cell identity regulation


## Tools for studying gene regulation


## Future Directions
