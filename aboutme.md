## <center> Welcome to my personal website!</center>

I am an MD/PhD student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mstp/) planning to graduate in 2021. My basic and translational research interests include cell identity, gene regulation, and regenerative therapeutics.

I recently defended my PhD in Genomics and Computational Biology advised by [Arjun Raj](https://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu). I am currently continuing my projects in the Raj lab on trends in gene regulation associated with the maintenance of cellular identity. I am also working with [Daniel Herman](https://www.med.upenn.edu/hermanlab/) in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Pathology Department using clinical informatics to track SARS-CoV-2 test results in the Philadelphia area. For information about my recent work, please see [publications](publications.html). 

Prior to graduate school I majored in Mathematics and a self-designed Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics curriculum at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments). I also worked as a research intern with Ron DePinho at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and with Aris Economides, Wen Fury, and David Frendewey at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

Outside of science and medicine I enjoy cooking, learning languages, traveling, and going on very long walks around cities and in the woods.
