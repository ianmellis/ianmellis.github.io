## <center> Welcome to my personal website!</center>


I am a research-track Clinical Pathology resident and postdoc at [Columbia](https://www.pathology.columbia.edu/). As of early 2023 I am working with [David Ho](https://www.adarc.cuimc.columbia.edu/research/research-labs/ho-lab) in the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center. Independently, I am also collaborating with [Yogesh Goyal (Northwestern)](https://www.goyallab.org/) on a project about gene regulatory networks.

I graduated from the MD/PhD program at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mstp/) in 2021. At Penn, I did my PhD in Genomics and Computational Biology, advised by [Arjun Raj](https://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu) (supported by an [F30 NRSA](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9691528&icde=50544554&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=)). I also worked with [Daniel Herman](https://www.med.upenn.edu/hermanlab/) in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Pathology Department, using clinical informatics to track SARS-CoV-2 test results in the Philadelphia area. For information about my recent work, please see [publications](publications.html). 

Prior to graduate school I majored in Mathematics and a self-designed Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics curriculum at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments). I also worked as a research intern with [Ron DePinho](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/depinho-laboratory.html) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and with Aris Economides, Wen Fury, and David Frendewey at [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals](https://www.regeneron.com/).

Outside of science and medicine I enjoy cooking, learning languages, traveling, and going on very long walks around cities and in the woods.
